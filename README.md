| q         | quality    | 0-100                   | Compression quality. The higher the number the nicer the image will look. I wouldnâ€™t recommend going any higher than about 95 else the image will get too large |
| a         | alignment  | c,t,l,r,b,tl,tr,bl,br   | Crop alignment. c = center, t = top, b = bottom, r = right, l = left. The positions can be joined to create diagonal positions                                  |
