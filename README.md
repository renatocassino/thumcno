Thumcno - A Tacno Thumbnail Generator in runtime
=================

## Pre requisites

To use thumcno, you need install the php-gd first.

```bash
 $ sudo apt-get install php-gd # Ubuntu
 $ sudo yum install php-gd # CentOs
 $ brew install php-gd # Mac OS
```

## Installation

You can install with the composer in an exist project or you can clone the project and begin to start to work!

If you want to install package via composer, you need to add in your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
   "require": {
      "tacnoman/thumcno": "dev-master"
      ...
   }
}
```

After install, you must create the directory with the config files. You can create with this command:
```
$ php vendor/bin/thumcno install /path/to/directory mydomain.com

# If you must a help, you can run
php vendor/bin/thumcno --help
```

Now, in your project you must insert the path in a define:

```php
define('THUMCNO_PATH','/path/to/directory');
```

Without composer
-----------------

```
git clone git@github.com:tacnoman/thumcno.git
cd thumcno
php -S localhost:8080
```

Based on timthumb:
http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/projects/timthumb/

You can use for any projects with different domains.

How it works?
------------------

The Google recommend that your dynamic images use another domain (or a subdomain) and with this lib you will can do it with multiple projects in different domains.

First step:
You need to create in folder `apps` a file called `<yourdomain>.ini`. In this file you will be set the params that you want (example: cache directory, etc).
This params will replace the params in default.ini (you can change it).

If you are using composer, you can run the command to create the file:
```
$ php vendor/bin/thumcno add:domain /path/to/directory mydomain.com
```

This is the `default.ini`.

```
; This document has default params
port = 80

debug_on = true    ; Enable debug logging to web server error log. Remember to update this param in your app
debug_level = 1 ; Debug level 1 is less noisy and 3 is the most noisy

memory_limit = 30M              ; Set PHP memory limit
block_external_leechers = false ; If the image or webshot is being loaded on an external site, display a red "No Hotlinking" gif.
display_error_messages = true   ; Display error messages. Set to false to turn off errors (good for production websites)

allow_external = false       ; Allow image fetching from external websites. Will check against ALLOWED_SITES if ALLOW_ALL_EXTERNAL_SITES is false
allow_external_sites = false ; Less secure.

file_cache_enabled = true              ; Should we store resized/modified images on disk to speed things up?
file_cache_time_between_cleans = 86400 ; How often the cache is cleaned

file_cache_max_file_age = 86400 ; How old does a file have to be to be deleted from the cache
file_cache_suffix = .thumcno    ; What to put at the end of all files in the cache directory so we can identify them
file_cache_prefix = null        ; What to put at the beg of all files in the cache directory so we can identify them
file_cache_directory = cache    ; Directory where images are cached. Left blank it will use the system temporary directory (which is better for security)
max_file_size = 10485760        ; 10 Megs is 10485760. This is the max internal or external file size that we'll process.
curl_timeout = 20               ; Timeout duration for Curl. This only applies if you have Curl installed and aren't using PHP's default URL fetching mechanism.
wait_between_fetch_errors = 3600; Time to wait between errors fetching remote file

; Browser caching
browser_cache_max_age = 864000 ; Time to cache in the browser
browser_cache_disable = false  ; Use for testing if you want to disable all browser caching

; Image size and defaults
max_width = 1500         ; Maximum image width
max_height = 1500        ; Maximum image height
not_found_image = null   ; Image to serve if any 404 occurs
error_image = ''         ; Image to serve if an error occurs instead of showing error message
png_is_transparent = true; Define if a png image should have a transparent background color. Use False value if you want to display a custom coloured canvas_colour
default_q = 90           ; Default image quality. Allows overrid in timthumb-config.php
default_zc = 1           ; Default zoom/crop setting. Allows overrid in timthumb-config.php
default_f = null         ; Default image filters. Allows overrid in timthumb-config.php
default_s = 0            ; Default sharpen value. Allows overrid in timthumb-config.php
default_cc = ffffff      ; Default canvas colour. Allows overrid in timthumb-config.php
default_width = 100      ; Default thumbnail width. Allows overrid in timthumb-config.php
default_height = 100     ; Default thumbnail height. Allows overrid in timthumb-config.php
```

You need to replace only the necessary.

See working in local machine
----------------------------

To see in local machine:

With composer
-------------

You must put this php code:

```php
include "vendor/autoload.php";

define('THUMCNO_PATH', '/path/to/directory');

$thumcno = new Tacnoman\Thumcno();
$thumcno->start();

exit();
```

Without composer
--------------

To see in your local machine, run this commands:

```
cd /path/to/thumbcno
php -S localhost:8080 index.php
```

Now, go to your browser and open the url:

http://localhost:8080/?src=/dubai.jpg&w=200&h=200&q=80

You will see this:


![dubai thumb](./example_image/thumbnail.jpg)

Possible params
-------------------

This list is the params that you can pass in url ($_GET):

Set possible sizes
-------------------

If you don't set the sizes, you could have a big problem!
Suppose that your URI is this `<w>/<h>/<src>`. A hacker could make a script to generate ALL POSSIBLE SIZES.

If your minimal size is 20 and the maximum size is 220, it's possible to generate (in a simple anagram 200x200) 40,000.
Disconsidering the quality. If you considerer the quality, a hacker could generate 4,000,000 images.

The thumcno will save all images in cache and this is a big problem.

But, now you can define the possible sizes to generate in your website. It's simple:

```
; <your_domain>.ini
; Possible_sizes
[sizes]
thumb = 30x30
medium = 200x200
large = 800x800
```

Now, you can generate thumbs only with sizes 30x30, 200x200 and 800x800.
If you don't want to show the size in the URL, you can use the `style` (like paperclip for ruby).

The style will replace the size. An example for this config is:

`http://<domain>/?src=dubai.jpg&style=medium` -> Without friendly url.
`http://<domain>/medium/dubai.jpg`            -> Considering a friendly url, where the uri is `/(?P<style>\w+)/(?P<src>(\w|-|\.)+)`.


Possible strategy
-------------------

Suppose that you have 3 projects (ex: project01, project02 and project03) with the urls http://project01.com, http://project02.com and http://project03.com.
All projects have a subdirectory called /uploads/ with the dynamic images.

You can make this steps:

First: Create files `i.project01.com.ini`, `i.project02.com.ini` and `i.project03.com.ini` in /apps directory.
Second: Use this params for each ini file.

```
port 80
file_cache_suffix = .project0<id>
file_cache_directory = cache
path_images = project_images_0<id>
```

Third: Create symbolic links to this folders:

```
ln -s /path/to/project<id>/uploads /path/to/thumbcno/project<id>
```

Fourth: Set your nginx/apache to root thumbcno project and try the url:

Ex: http://i.project01.com?src=images/dubai.jpg&width=300&h=300

URL Friendly
---------------

If you want to use friendly urls, you can set the params in your .ini file passing the URLS params. (You must know abour regex)
The param is `route` and you can use the same url params in this format:

```
(?P<name_of_param>\regex)
ex: (?P<w>\d+) -> Regex for para w (width) accepting only integers values

Another example:
^\/(?P<w>\d+)x(?P<h>\d+)\/(?P<q>\d{1,3})\/?
/<width>x<height>/<quality>/?src=example_images/dubai.jpg

One more example:
^\/(?P<w>\d+)x(?P<h>\d+)\/(?P<q>\d{1,3})\/(?<src>[\w.-]+)?
/<width>x<height>/<quality>/<source.jpg>
http://localhost:8080/200x200/80/dubai.jpg

Ps: If you don't set any params in your regex, you can pass like $_GET param.
```
